# Microcanonical Monte Carlo

Software for microcanonical Monte Carlo simulation realized as a random walk through configurations while enforcing a constant total energy. This is possible due to the presence of an added degree of freedom, a 'demon', that can give or remove energy from the system. Below is the algorithm in action for a 2D Ising model, here visualized as a network.
